# UpChallenge


# What is it?

UpChallenge is an iOS application that's built to help you excercise without a gym trainer. 

# How does it work? 

The application uses AVSpeechsynthesizer API to dictate workout instructions. You just need to follow along. 

Workout instructions are configurable, using a JSON payload. 

Example: 
```
{   "name": "Sally Up", // name of the workout
    "lyrics":[ 
              {
              "time":1,  // at time equals to 1 second, the application will dictate this line of lyric 
              "lyric":"Bring Sally up and bring Sally down. Lift and squat, gotta tear the ground."
              },
              {
              "time":10,
              "lyric":"Bring Sally up and bring Sally down. Lift and squat, gotta tear the ground."
              ]
}
```
# Why did I build this?

I was inspired by the Sally Up Challenge.

# Future plans 

- Send JSON payload from a backend server 
- Support storing multiple workout payloads
